## How it works

The PTAT sensor allows temperature detection. It sends a voltage value `vts` to its output, which is buffered `out_buff`. Next, there is a Mixed-Signal Σ − ∆ block to convert the voltage value into digital pulses through sigma- delta modulation on `out` .

## How to test

Measure the temperature of the environment and measure the voltage coming out of the buffer `out_buff` at some temperature values to calibrate the sensor and find the linear equation. Observe the pulses being modulated at the output `out`.

## External hardware

Measure the temperature of the environment and measure the voltage coming out of the buffer `out_buff` at some temperature values to calibrate the sensor and find the linear equation. Observe the pulses being modulated at the output `out`.
